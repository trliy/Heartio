# Heartio

Heartio is a **community-made Stremio addon** that brings live radio stations into Stremio using iHeartRadio sources.

**Description:**  
A radio streaming service for Stremio.

This addon is provided as-is for the community. It is not official and is not affiliated with iHeartRadio or Stremio.

---

## What Works

- Most stations play **directly inside Stremio**
- Search and browsing are supported
- Live radio streams load dynamically
- No accounts or additional setup required

For the majority of stations, you can simply click and listen.

---

## Known Issues

Some stations **do not play directly in Stremio’s built-in player**.

This can happen due to:
- Stream formats Stremio does not fully support
- Inconsistent or changing stream URLs
- Provider-side restrictions

These issues are common with live radio streams and are outside the full control of this addon.

## How to Play Stations That Don’t Start

If a station does not play inside Stremio:

1. Open the station
2. Select the stream
3. Choose **“Copy video download link”**
4. Paste the link into:
   - A web browser, or
   - An external media player such as VLC

In most cases, the stream itself is valid. Stremio just cannot play it directly.

## What to Expect

- This is a **community addon**, not an official service
- Station availability may change at any time
- Some stations may stop working without notice
- Not every station is guaranteed to work inside Stremio

If most stations work and a few do not, this is considered normal behavior.

## Disclaimer

Heartio does **not host, store, or rebroadcast** any audio streams.  
It only indexes publicly available radio streams from third-party sources.

All station names, logos, and trademarks belong to their respective owners.
